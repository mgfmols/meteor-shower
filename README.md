## Important to know
When playing the game, save data for the leaderboard is stored using **PlayerPrefs**, meaning data is stored in the Windows Registry.
When using Unity to open the project, any Play Mode data is stored at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Unity\UnityEditor\DefaultCompany\GameJam`
and when making a build, the data is stored at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\DefaultCompany\GameJam`.

## About the project
This project was during a game jam. Together with a friend, we spent 1 afternoon making the game. Assets originate from SyntyStore, so no work was done there.
Gameplay, player controls, sounds and procedural generation was made during the game jam.

## My contribution
I was partly responsible for the design of the entire game. I developed the score system, player controller and the menus for this game.
